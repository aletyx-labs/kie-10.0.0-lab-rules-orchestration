# Lab: Letâ€™s orchestrate Rules and Decisions!

The workflow use case started within Apache KIE many many years ago to cover exactly this use case: orchestrate complex rule sets. Back in the days, there was no RuleUnits nor DMN, it was a very good way to visualize and organize rule-set orchestration by leveraging a graphical model notation. 

It started with a RuleFlow file (.rf), but quickly the Apache KIE evolved and fully embraced the BPMN format.

## Lab Overview

You will create a BPMN process that will orchestrate 1 DMN decision and 1 DRL RuleUnit. 

1. Get Driver information (could be from a Database)
1. Validate the driver's license based on expiration date
1. If valid, we'll check if the driver's license should be suspended based on the Traffic Violation

### Supporting Files

The Java services provided in the repository https://github.com/aletyx-labs/kie-10.0.0-lab-rules-orchestration contain the infrastructure to support this process. Below is a brief description of each file:

Here is the Markdown-formatted description of the uploaded files:

#### Driver.java

Represents a driver entity with personal details and license status.

- Attributes include `id`, `name`, `state`, `city`, `points`, `age`, and `licenseExpiration`.
- Tracks whether the driver has a valid license (`validLicense`).
- Includes getter and setter methods for all attributes.

#### DriverService.java

Service responsible for retrieving driver information.

- `getDriver(driverId)`: Retrieves driver details, potentially from an external service or database.
- Mocks driver data, including randomly determining license expiration based on the driver's ID. This could be a database access to retrieve such information.

#### Fine.java

Represents a traffic fine with associated penalties.

- Attributes:
  - `amount`: Monetary fine imposed.
  - `points`: The number of penalty points added to the driver's record.
- Includes getter and setter methods.

#### LicenseValidationService.java

RuleUnitData that provides single driver for validation using rule-based decision-making.

- Uses `SingletonStore<Driver>` to manage a single driver's data.
- Provides methods to set and retrieve driver data.
- Includes `getCurrentTime()` to return the current timestamp.

#### Violation.java

Represents a traffic violation event.

- Attributes:
  - `code`: Unique identifier for the violation.
  - `date`: Date when the violation occurred.
  - `type`: Type of violation (e.g., speeding).
  - `speedLimit`: Allowed speed for the road.
  - `actualSpeed`: Speed at which the driver was caught.
- Includes a constructor and getter/setter methods.

#### LicenseValidationService.drl

File that provides all Rules for LicenseValidationService unit. In this case there're two simple rules that validates the driver's license based on expiration date.

`driver` and `currentTime` are provided by LicenseValidationService unit.

#### TrafficViolation.dmn

Decision that evaluates if a driver should be suspended or not. It takes the Driver and a Violation as input data, evaluates the fine for the violation and using the result of the Fine decision, defines if the Driver should be suspended or not.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the lab project from this repository, which contains all the necessary files and infrastructure for the lab.

#### Step 2: Import the Project

Import the project into VS Code and explore the provided Java classes.

#### Step 3: Create the BPMN file

Create a new file name traffic.bpmn under src/main/resources and open it using the Apache KIE BPMN Editor.

Once file is created, create the process variables that we'll need.

| Name      | Data Type                                            |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| suspended | String                                               |
| driverId  | String                                               |
| violation | ai.aletyx.kie.workshop.rules.orchestration.Violation |
| driver    | ai.aletyx.kie.workshop.rules.orchestration.Driver    |
| fine      | ai.aletyx.kie.workshop.rules.orchestration.Fine      |

#### Step 4: Create the process diagram

Our goal is to orchestrate the DRLs and the DMN, we'll load Driver content based on it, evaluate the license with DRL and then we'll run the DMN.

In general this is the nodes you'll have to create:

1. Start Event: Initiates the traffic rules orchestration process.
2. Get Driver Details Service Task

     Interface: ai.aletyx.kie.workshop.rules.orchestration.DriverService

     Operation: getDriver

     Variables - Input Mapping:

     | Name   | Data Type | Source     |
     |--------|----------|------------|
     | param1 | String   | driverId   |

     Variables - Output Mapping:

     | Name   | Data Type                                           | Target |
     |--------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
     | result | Driver [ai.aletyx.kie.workshop.rules.orchestration] | driver |

3. LicenseValidation with DRL Bussiness Rules Task

     Rule Language: DRL

     Rule Flow Group: unit:ai.aletyx.kie.workshop.rules.orchestration.LicenseValidationService

     |--------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
     | driver | Driver [ai.aletyx.kie.workshop.rules.orchestration] | driver |

     Variables - Output Mapping:

     | Name   | Data Type                                           | Target |
     |--------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
     | driver | Driver [ai.aletyx.kie.workshop.rules.orchestration] | driver |

4. Exclusive Gateway: We'll check if the Reserve was successfull or not.
    - On Fail 

        ```java
        return !driver.isValidLicense();
        ```

        4.1. End event

    - On Success

        ```java
        return driver.isValidLicense(); 
        ```

        4.3. Script Task

        Script:
            ```java
                System.out.println("Result for suspension: " + suspended)
                System.out.println("Result for fine: " + fine)
            ```
        4.4. End Event

#### Step 5: Test the Process

You can also use the following code to test:

```java
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import io.restassured.http.ContentType;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.is;

@QuarkusTest
public class TrafficProcessTest {

    public static final BigDecimal SPEED_LIMIT = new BigDecimal(100);

    @Test
    public void testTrafficViolationEmbeddedDecisionOnQuarkus() {
        testTrafficProcess("traffic", "12345", 120d, "No", true);
        testTrafficProcess("traffic", "12345", 140d, "Yes", true);
        testTrafficProcess("traffic", "1234", 140d, null, false);
    }

    private void testTrafficProcess(String processId, String driverId, Double speed, String suspended, Boolean validLicense) {
        Map<String, Object> request = new HashMap<>();
        request.put("driverId", driverId);
        request.put("violation", new Violation("speed", SPEED_LIMIT, new BigDecimal(speed)));
        given()
                .body(request)
                .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
                .when()
                .post("/" + processId)
                .then()
                .statusCode(201)
                .body("suspended", is(suspended))
                .body("driver.validLicense", is(validLicense));
    }
}
```
